    <h1>White Rice</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Perfect fluffly white rice</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>White Rice - 1 cups</li>
                    <li>Water - 2 cups</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add rice and water to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, lower heat to a simmer and cover. Ensure it’s simmering and not boiling or the rice can cook too quickly.</li>
                    <li>Simmer until water is completely absorbed and rice is tender – about 15-25 minutes (will depend on size and freshness of rice). Drain off any excess water if there is any (there shouldn’t be).</li>
                    <li>I like to turn off the heat, remove the lid, fluff with a fork, put the lid back on, and let rest for 10 minutes so the moisture redistributes to prevent mushy rice. </li>
                    <li>Store cooled leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 5-6 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop with a little oil or water until warm.</li>
                </ul>
